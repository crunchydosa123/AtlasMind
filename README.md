MindGrid is a personal knowledge management system that helps you store, organize, and connect information efficiently. It follows the PARA framework (Projects, Areas, Resources, Archives) while building a graph of interconnected concepts behind the scenes—turning your ideas into a living, searchable knowledge network.

## ✨ Features
- PARA-Based Organization
- Organize everything you capture into the PARA structure:
- Projects – short-term efforts with clear goals
- Areas – ongoing responsibilities
- Resources – reference materials
- Archives – inactive items

### Graph-Powered Knowledge Connections
- Every note, idea, or resource becomes a node in your knowledge graph.
- MindGrid automatically creates links using: Shared concepts & keywords and Semantic similarity

### Intelligent Search
Find relevant information through:
- Vector-based semantic search
- Graph traversal
